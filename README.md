This is a small project I've been working on to improve my coding chops. If you want to try out this game:
1) Download the .zip file:
   - If you're not already here, first navigate to https://github.com/Jay5th/MyCheckers.
   - Press on the green button labelled "Code" near the top of the page.
   - Press on "Download ZIP" to download all of the files in this repository. The file should be called "MyCheckers-master.zip".
2) Extract the contents of the .zip file to some location on your computer (the default location is probably the "Downloads" folder).
3) Click through the extracted file, and navigate to the python file "MainWindow.py".
4) Using a python editor (for example, IDLE), open and run "MainWindow.py".
5) If this doesn't immediately work, make sure you have the libraries "playsound", "tkinter", "dataclasses", and "PIL" installed.
6) Enjoy the game!
